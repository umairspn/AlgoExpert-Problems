# Graph Problems are most common in the top FAANG companies  

### Graphs are probably hard to grasp, but they are very fun once a strong understanding of the graphs and their properties and Traversals are understood 


### This repository includes the file "Graphs from Scratch" that is highly recommended when starting off with graphs 


#### It boils down to DFS and BFS for every graph problem 


##### It's important to know their tradeoffs 



###### Ideally, DFS should be done via Recursion -- while BFS should be done via Iteration (Queues)
