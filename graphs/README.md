# Graph Problems are very common in FAANG and other big companies  

### Graphs are probably hard to grasp, but they are very fun once a strong understanding of the graphs and their properties and traversals are understood 


This repository includes the file "Graphs from Scratch" that is highly recommended when starting off with graphs 

1. It boils down to DFS and BFS for every graph problem 

2. It's important to know their tradeoffs 

3. Ideally, DFS should be done via Recursion -- while BFS should be done via Iteration (Queues) 
 



DFS | BFS
------------ | -------------
Finding All Paths | Finding Shortest Path
Do it Recursively | Do it Iteratively
Stacks comes in   | Queues comes in
