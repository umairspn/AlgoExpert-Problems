# Trees and Binary Search Trees 


## In this section, I include some of the most important "Trees" problems that might come in the coding interviews 

1. Basic Traversals -- DFS and BFS with both (Iteration and Recursion) 
2. Invert Binary Tree 
3. Is a Subtree part of the Main Tree 
4. Root to leaf paths Sum 
5. Is this Tree a Valid Binary Search Tree (remember the properties of BST) 
6. Is a given Tree Height Balanced? 
7. Diameter of a Tree 
8. Serialize and Desirialize Tree (In Process)
