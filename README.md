# AlgoExpert-Problems
I solve AlgoExpert problems on daily basis to master my problem-solving skills. 
AlgoExpert Questions provides deep insights into problems that comes up at top companies like FAANG and how to master them.  

## What I Learned from this journey so far  

1. Learn Problem Solving Skills that can be applied to any real-world problem 
2. Learn how to think critically and break down the problem 
3. Learn the tradeoffs of different data structure that can be used to solve a given problem 
4. Learn the complexities -- Space and Time Analysis 
5. Learn how to write clean and understandable code 


## My Perosnal Breakdown of the world of "Data Structures and Algorithms" 

Data Structures | Algorithms
------------ | -------------
Lists and Strings | Brute Force --> Optimal Solutions (2 Pointer, Using Hash, Sliding Window)  
Dictionaries or Hashmaps | Importance of Key:Value and O(1) lookups --> Optimizing Structure
Linked Lists | Simple but Effective (Important to know the tradeoffs) 
Stacks and Queues | Importance of LIFO and FIFO and how they relate to Recursion 
Trees --> Graphs | Recursion and Call Stack  
Dynamic Programming | Completely reverse the thought process of Recrusion --> Instead, build solution on the go (HARD)



#### Programming Language
