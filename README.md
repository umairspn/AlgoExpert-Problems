# Data Structure and Algorithms - LeetCode, AlgoExpert
I solve Leetcode and AlgoExpert problems on daily basis to master my problem-solving skills. 
AlgoExpert Questions provides deep insights into problems that comes up at top companies like FAANG and how to master them.  

## What I Learned from this journey so far  

1. Learn Problem Solving Skills that can be applied to any real-world problem 
2. Learn how to think critically and break down the problem 
3. Learn the tradeoffs of different data structure that can be used to solve a given problem 
4. Learn the complexities -- Space and Time Analysis 
5. Learn how to write clean, understandable, and scalable code 


## My Perosnal Breakdown of the world of "Data Structures and Algorithms" 

Data Structures | Algorithms
------------ | -------------
Lists and Strings | Brute Force --> Optimal Solutions (2 Pointer, Using Hash, Sliding Window)  
Dictionaries or Hashmaps | Importance of Key:Value and O(1) lookups --> Optimizing Structure
Linked Lists | Simple but Effective (Important to know the tradeoffs) 
Stacks and Queues | Importance of LIFO and FIFO and how they relate to Recursion and Call Stack
Trees --> Graphs | DFS and BFS, Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix 
Dynamic Programming | Can we build a solution on the go? (Hard) 



### Programming Language 
I used Python for these 

I can code in C++, and Java too 

Programming language makes no difference when it comes to problem solving 

The general idea remains the same, merely the syntax changes

Though, it's improtant to know the tradeoffs between differernt programming languages!
